# TOONWare

TOONWare is a lightweight, model-agnostic middleware that sits between your application and any LLM API. It automatically detects and converts JSON payloads into the **TOON (Token-Oriented Object Notation)** format — reducing token usage by 30–60% while preserving structure and meaning. Designed for organizations that spend heavily on tokenized APIs, TOONWare offers automatic compression, detailed cost metrics, and seamless integration with existing LLM pipelines.
